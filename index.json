However, due to natural evolution of microbes and inappropriate usages of antibiotics in healthcare and agriculture, antibiotic resistance has become an urgent problem world wide. In addition, due to various reasons 1, development of new antibiotics, especially those with novel structures and targets, has slowed down in the past decades. In the near future, emergence of widely spread antibiotic resistant micro-organism will cause more problems in the developing world where antibiotics are more frequently prescribed. Therefore, novel methods for antibiotics discovery are urgently needed.\nMethods I\u0026rsquo;m leading a dedicated team for a seriecs of projects for antibiotic discovery with both in-silico and in-vitro approaches. From the alrogithmic perspective, we are focusing the following directions:\n Protein language model: we have access to ~1,000 NVIDIA V100 GPUs Meta learning Generative model Self-supervised learning on graphs  We will synthesize the our generated the antibiotics in the wet-lab.\nSeeking Collaboration \u0026amp; Recruiting Interns  Last update: Apr 29, 2021\n  If you are senior researcher and is interested to collaborate or just want to know more, I\u0026rsquo;d be very happy to chat. If you are a junior highly-motivated students (e.g. senior undergraduate or junior master or PhD students), I, together with my postdoc supervisors, can host you as a remote intern.  Note that, I\u0026rsquo;m a hands-on senior postdoc: I\u0026rsquo;d like to give very concrete suggestions and have frequent (can be short) 1-1 meetings with junior student. I also prefer writing detailed documents so that team members can agree on the technical details more quickly.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been supervising junior students since 2015, and you can find more about my mentoring experience at this page.\n  Most pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the development of new antibiotics and have instead focused on developing more profitable drugs for non-communicable diseases. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1619654400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619654400,"objectID":"a146e13532469553163d72e7254e158d","permalink":"/project/antibiotic_discovery/","publishdate":"2021-04-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/antibiotic_discovery/","section":"project","summary":"active learning framework","tags":["Drug Discovery"],"title":"Antibiotic Discovery","type":"project"},{"authors":["Aston Zhang","Yi Tay","Shuai Zhang","Alvin Chan","Anh Tuan Luu","Siu Cheung Hui","Jie Fu"],"categories":null,"content":" Our paper received the Outstanding Paper Award (8 out of 860 accepted papers).

      <title>Antibiotic Discovery</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Discovery and development of antibiotics have significantly reduced the burdens of infectious disease in human population in the past.
However, due to natural evolution of microbes and inappropriate usages of antibiotics in healthcare and agriculture, antibiotic resistance has become an urgent problem world wide.
In addition, due to various reasons &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, development of new antibiotics, especially those with novel structures and targets, has slowed down in the past decades.
In the near future, emergence of widely spread antibiotic resistant micro-organism will cause more problems in the developing world where antibiotics are more frequently prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, antibiotics were mostly developed by screening secondary metabolites and their semi-synthetic derivatives of soil-dwelling microbes for inhibiting growth of pathogenic microorganism.
However, due to increasing difficulties in identifying effective chemicals from the space among secondary metabolites, no new clinical antibiotics has been discovered using this method since 1980s.
Therefore, novel methods for antibiotics discovery are urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the development of new antibiotics and have instead focused on developing more profitable drugs for non-communicable diseases. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on drug-target interaction prediction projects, which can be used to screen potential drugs.
I&amp;rsquo;m adapting tools from NLP community, e.g. language models.
Wil share results soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on protein remote homology detection projects.
I&amp;rsquo;m adapting tools from IR community.
Wil share results soon.&lt;/p&gt;
